to perform constructor injection :
1. create  java class(Person) then generate getter , setter , parameter constructor , override toString()
2. create a bean in xml
3. to perform constrctor injection use :
there are 3 ways:
    (1) Value as tag or element:
    ex:
        <constructor-arg>
            <value></value>
        </constructor-arg>
    (2) value as attribute:
    ex:
    <constructor-arg value=""/>
    (3) as c schema:
    ex :constructor injection using c shcema
            <bean class="org.springcore.constrctorInjection.Certi" name="cer"
                    c:name = "Python">
            </bean>

NOTE:  to ressolve a


Ambiguity problem with constrctor injection:
Problem : when there are several override constrctor , spring got confuse , beacuse normal behaviour of constructor-args in xml is
  - it will consider value as String.
  _ if there is no String value in constructor , then it will run seqence of constrctor.
  - but if there are String constrctor as well it will first run String params constructor.
Practical :
1. create a class (Addition)
2. Create constrctor with int and double
 -- it will run in seqence
3. create constructor with String
    -- now spring will run String constructor
solution :
4. -- use type attribute in constructor injection
 ex :<constructor-arg value="12" type = "int" />
5. if you want to define index also you can use
 ex: <constructor-arg value="34" type = "int" index="0"/>
